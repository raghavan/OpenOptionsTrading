# Algorithms for Options Trading
Here is a table with risk, reward, time, and a generated title based on the cell values:

| Title                                 | Risk  | Reward | Time  |
|---------------------------------------|-------|--------|-------|
| Safe-Sprinter.py                         | Low   | Good   | Short |
| Steady-Marathon.py                      | Low   | Better | Long  |
| Volatile-Velocity.py (you bet)                     | High  | Best   | Short |

The titles were generated as follows:

1. Safe Sprinter
   - Low risk 
   - Short wait time

2. Steady Marathon
   - Low risk
   - Long wait time

3. Volatile Velocity
   - High risk
   - Short wait time + Best returns

The titles aim to capture the essence of each trading algorithm based on its risk characteristics, reward potential, and time horizon.
