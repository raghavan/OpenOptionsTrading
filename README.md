# OpenOptionsTrading
Python program to choose the best Option trading stratgey based on risk/reward criteria.

# Algorithms for Options Trading
This implementation provides a fast and efficient way to calculate implied volatility using the Newton-Raphson method. It can be used as part of a larger options trading strategy to estimate market expectations and make informed trading decisions.

Here is a table with risk, reward, time, and a generated title based on the cell values:

| Title                                 | Risk  | Reward | Time  |
|---------------------------------------|-------|--------|-------|
| Safe-Sprinter.py                         | Low   | Good   | Short |
| Steady-Marathon.py                      | Low   | Better | Long  |
| Volatile-Velocity.py (you bet)                     | High  | Best   | Short |

The titles were generated as follows:

1. Safe Sprinter
   - Low risk 
   - Short wait time

2. Steady Marathon
   - Low risk
   - Long wait time

3. Volatile Velocity
   - High risk
   - Short wait time + Best returns
